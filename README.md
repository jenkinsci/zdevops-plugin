# Zowe zDevOps Jenkins plugin

## About the plugin
The Zowe zDevOps Jenkins Plugin by [IBA Group](https://ibagroupit.com/?utm_campaign=IBA_W-Mainframe&utm_source=jenkins&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=description_zdevops) is an open-source, secure , and reliable agent-less Jenkins plugin that makes it possible to perform most of the actual tasks on the mainframe, managing it with a modern native mainframe zOSMF REST API and the capabilities of available zOSMF SDKs.

## Main features
- Secure and modern connection of Jenkins to the mainframes through the use of zOSMF REST API.
- The functionality is based on the Kotlin SDK methods, such as JCL jobs submission, download, allocate, write to the dataset, etc., with a log collected upon completion.
- Multiple connections to various mainframes â€” z/OS Connections List where you can save all the necessary systems and credentials (all data is safely stored under the protection of Jenkins Credentials manager).
- Agent-less solution.
- z/OSMF connection validation.
- Convenient user interface panels for working with the mainframe
- Fast execution and functional extensibility.

## Before use - Plugin configuration
After successfully installing the plugin, you need to configure it for further work - this will require a minimum of actions.
1. Move to 'Manage Jenkins' -> 'Configure System / System' -> scroll to the very bottom of the list of installed plugins and find the panel with the name - <b>'z/OS Connection List'</b>
2. This setting allows you to add all necessary z/OS systems and configure access to them.
   It is necessary to set the connection name (it is also the ID for declarative methods in the code). For the example: ```z/os-connection-name```
3. The URL address and port of the required mainframe to connect via z/OSMF. Example: ```https://<ip-addres>:<port number>```
4. Add credentials (Mainframe User ID + Password) under which you can connect to the system.

You can save as many connections as you like, the system will keep the corresponding user IDs/passwords.

## Declarative Methods Detail Description

### allocateDS - Represents an action for allocating a dataset in a declarative style
```groovy
zosmf ("z/os-connection-name") {
    allocateDS(
        // Mandatory Parameters below:
        dsn: "EXAMPLE.DATASET",
        dsOrg: "PS",
        primary: 1,
        secondary: 1,
        recFm: "FB",
        failOnExist:"False",
        // Optional Parameters below:
        volser:"YOURVOL",
        unit:"SYSDA",
        alcUnit:"TRK",
        dirBlk:"5",
        blkSize:"800",
        lrecl:"80",
        storClass:"STORAGECLASS",
        mgntClass:"MGMTCLASS",
        dataClass:"DATACLASS",
        avgBlk:"10",
        dsnType:"LIBRARY",
        dsModel:"MODEL.DATASET.NAME"
    )
}
```
**Mandatory Parameters:**
   * ```dsn:"EXAMPLE.DATASET"``` - The name of the dataset to be allocated
   * ```dsOrg:"PS"``` - The dataset organization (could be only PO, POE, PS, VS)
   * ```primary:"1"``` - The primary allocation size in cylinders or tracks
   * ```secondary:"1"``` - The secondary allocation size in cylinders or tracks
   * ```recFm:"FB"``` - The record format (could be only F, FB, V, VB, U, VSAM, VA)
   * ```failOnExist:"False"``` - If the dataset already exists and the option is enabled, execution will halt. (Boolean parameter, is set to 'False' by default)

**Optional parms:**
   * ```volser:"YOURVOL"``` - Volume serial number where the dataset will be allocated.
   * ```unit:"SYSDA"``` - Specifies the type of storage device. SYSDA is a common direct access storage device.
   * ```alcUnit:"TRK"``` - Allocation units (CYL for cylinders, TRK for tracks).
   * ```dirBlk:"5"``` - Directory block records.
   * ```blkSize:"800"``` - BLKSIZE=800: Block size of 800 bytes.
   * ```lrecl:"80"``` - Logical record length.
   * ```storClass:"STORAGECLASS"``` - Storage class for SMS-managed datasets.
   * ```mgntClass:"MGMTCLASS"``` - Management class for SMS-managed datasets.
   * ```dataClass:"DATACLASS"``` - Data class for SMS-managed datasets.
   * ```avgBlk:"10"``` - Average block length.
   * ```dsnType:"LIBRARY"``` - Specifies the type of dataset, LIBRARY for a PDS or PDSE.
   * ```dsModel:"MODEL.DATASET.NAME"``` - Data set model is a predefined set of attributes that can be used to allocate new data sets with the same characteristics ("LIKE" parameter).


### deleteDataset - Represents an action for deleting datasets and members in a declarative style
```groovy
zosmf ("z/os-connection-name") {
    deleteDataset dsn: "EXAMPLE.DATASET", member:"MEMBER", failOnNotExist:"False"
}
```
**Mandatory Parameters:**
   * ```dsn:"EXAMPLE.DATASET"``` - Sequential or library dataset name for deletion
   * ```member:"MEMBER"``` - Dataset member name for deletion
   * ```failOnNotExist:"False"``` - If the dataset has been deleted and the option is enabled, execution will halt. (Boolean parameter, is set to 'False' by default)

**Expected behavior under various deletion scenarios:**

* To delete a member from the library, the dsn and member parameters must be specified:
    ```
    deleteDataset dsn:"EXAMPLE.DATASET", member:"MEMBER", failOnNotExist:"False"
    ```

* You cannot delete a VSAM dataset this way. Otherwise, you will get output similar to:
    ```
    Deleting dataset EXAMPLE.VSAM.DATASET with connection <ip-address>:10443 
    ISRZ002 Deallocation failed - Deallocation failed for data set 'EXAMPLE.VSAM.DATASET'
    ```

* What do you get if a dataset does not exist?

    ```
    Deleting dataset EXAMPLE.DS.DOES.NOT.EXIST with connection <ip-address>:10443
    ISRZ002 Data set not cataloged - 'EXAMPLE.DS.DOES.NOT.EXIST' was not found in catalog.
    ```

* What do you get if a dataset is busy by a user or a program?

    ```
    Deleting dataset EXAMPLE.DS.ISUSED.BY.USER with connection <ip-address>:10443
    ISRZ002 Data set in use - Data set 'EXAMPLE.DS.ISUSED.BY.USER' in use by another user, try later or enter HELP for a list of jobs and users allocated to 'EXAMPLE.DS.ISUSED.BY.USER'.
    ```

## Use case example
Here you can find an example of a minimal declarative Jenkins pipeline for execution, testing and further modification for your personal needs.
Pipeline can be used either directly inside the ```Pipeline``` code block in the Jenkins server, or in a ```Jenkinsfile``` stored in Git
This pipeline example uses all currently available methods and functionality of the Zowe zDevOps plugin.

**Steps to Execute the Pipeline:**
1. Add a zosmf connection in settings (<b>'Manage Jenkins' -> 'Configure System / System' -> z/OS Connection List</b>). Enter a connection name, zosmf url, username and password.
2. Create a new Jenkins item -> ```Pipeline``` and open its configuration.
3. In the ```Pipeline``` section, paste the code from the example below and replace all the necessary variables with your data
4. Done, enjoy the minimal ready-made pipeline template!

## Manual plugin installation by the .hpi executable file
The plugin are packaged as self-contained <b>.hpi</b> files, which have all the necessary code, images, and other resources which the plugin needs to operate successfully.

### <b>Already packaged and tested installation .hpi file can be downloaded from a link from a nearby GitHub repository:</b>
### <b>[Zowe zDevOps plugin installation .hpi file](https://github.com/IBA-mainframe-dev/Global-Repository-for-Mainframe-Developers/blob/master/Jenkins%20zOS%20DevOps%20plugin%20installable%20hpi/zos-devops.hpi)</b>

Assuming a <b>.hpi</b> file has been downloaded, a logged-in Jenkins administrator may upload the file from within the web UI:
1. Navigate to the <b>Manage Jenkins > Plugins</b> page in the web UI.
2. Click on the <b>Advanced</b> tab.
3. Choose the <b>.hpi</b> file from your system or enter a URL to the archive file under the <b>Deploy Plugin</b> section.
4. <b>Deploy</b> the plugin file.

## Manual Jenkins plugin installation (Installation via source code build and .hpi file upload)
1. Download the Zowe zDevOps Jenkins plugin source code from its [official GitHub repository](https://github.com/jenkinsci/zdevops-plugin)
2. It is necessary to build the project with the help of the Maven Build Tool
3. To generate the ```target``` dir with generated-sources - you have to run the Maven command: ```mvn localizer:generate```
4. Next, you need to generate an installation file: .hpi or .jpi file (both are installation files for the Jenkins plugin). This can be done by executing Maven command ```mvn install``` or by ```mvn hpi:hpi```.
5. After building the .hpi/.jpi file, it should appear in a <b><Plugin-project-name>/build/libs/<hpi_file_name>.hpi</b> directory
6. Next you need to login into the Jenkins, move to the <b>'Manage Jenkins' -> 'Plugins' -> 'Advanced settings (tab)' -> 'Deploy Plugin'</b> (You can select a plugin file from your local system or provide a URL to install a plugin from outside the central plugin repository) <b>-> Specify the path to the generated .hpi/.jpi file</b> (or by dragging the file from Intellij IDEA project to the file upload field in the Jenkins).
7. Click <b>'Deploy'</b>, reboot Jenkins after installation. The Plugin is ready to go!

## How to run Jenkins plugin in Debug mode in a local Jenkins sandbox

For debugging purposes run following Maven command from plugin project directory:

```./mvnw hpi:run```

Or by ```mvnDebug hpi:run``` - this will copy all the dependencies down (rather than in your jenkins install) and run it in place.

By default, the debugging instance is then available at [http://localhost:8080/jenkins](http://localhost:8080/jenkins) in your browser.

In order to launch Jenkins on a different port than 8080 use this system property:

```./mvnw hpi:run -Djetty.port=8090```

Changing the default context path can be achieved by setting this system property:

```./mvnw hpi:run -Dhpi.prefix=/debug```

## How to run unit-tests with JaCoCo report

```./mvnw clean verify```

The results are available under `target/site/jacoco/index.html`
